## 👤 **My Role – Gyalbu Sherpa**
As the system analyst and database architect on this team project, I contributed to:

- Designing the conceptual data model and determining business rules  
- Defining entities, attributes, and relational structures  
- Performing functional dependency analysis  
- Normalizing all relations into **Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
- Validating the ERD and transforming the logical model into SQL table structures  
- Ensuring the database supported real business needs such as inventory accuracy, item lookup, and order tracking  

My work focused on creating a **clean, structured, and scalable database** that reduces redundancy, improves accuracy, and supports real-time operational efficiency for a retail store.

## 🧾 **Project Overview**
This project involved building a complete **Retail Inventory Management Database System** to help a clothing retailer overcome challenges with manual inventory tracking, stock inaccuracies, and customer lookup issues.

The final system handles:
- Product inventory  
- Stock location mapping  
- Customer information & preferences  
- Sales orders & order items  
- Store details  
- Purchase orders & procurement tracking  

The goal was to create a **fully normalized relational schema** that improves data integrity, enhances store operations, and enables reliable decision-making.

## 📊 **Key Findings**
- Manual tracking caused frequent **stock inaccuracies**, slow service, and customer dissatisfaction.  
- Inventory needed to be tied to **aisle, bin, shelf, and floor** to allow precise in-store item lookup.  
- Analysis showed major redundancy across product, order, and customer information.  
- Normalization to **3NF** significantly improved data accuracy and eliminated duplicate records.  
- Linking products to locations, orders, and stores enabled **end-to-end visibility** across all retail operations.  
- Incorporating purchase orders enabled the store to better manage **replenishment and vendor relations**.

## 🧠 **How the Project Was Completed**

### **1. Requirements Analysis**
- Identified core business problems  
- Defined the data needed for retail inventory, ordering, and store management  

### **2. Entity & Attribute Definition**
Created structured definitions for:
- Store  
- Customer  
- Product  
- Location  
- Customer_Order  
- Order_Items  
- Purchase_Order  
- Purchase_Order_Items  

### **3. ERD Modeling**
- Designed a full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
- Mapped relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many where needed)  
- Ensured referential integrity  

### **4. Functional Dependency Analysis**
- Identified all dependencies  
- Removed partial, transitive, and repeating groups  

### **5. Normalization (1NF → 2NF → 3NF)**
- Cleaned data  
- Eliminated redundancy  
- Achieved database efficiency and reliability  

### **6. SQL Schema Construction**
- Created normalized tables using SQL  
- Added primary & foreign keys  
- Enforced constraints and referential integrity  

### **7. Forms, Queries & Reporting**
- Created input forms for data entry  
- Built queries for inventory, orders, and customer lookup  
- Designed reports for store managers
